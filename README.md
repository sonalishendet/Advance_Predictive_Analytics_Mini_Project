https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshalpatel3558/diabetes-prediction-dataset-legit-dataset  

# Objective #
Train and tune the following classifiers using Grid Search with cross-validation, evaluate them using Log Loss, and determine which model performs the best:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost

LightGBM

(Log Loss measures how well predicted probabilities align with actual classes — lower is better.)
